## Description:
>[!NOTE]
>Home page is not functional due to API method depricated

I made this project entirely because I hated spotify ads interrupting my experience..
I integrated the YouTube and Spotify API to allow searching and playing of song titles, this is completely legal as I have read through the TOS and Policies.
This project is not commercially viable due to API limitations and potential API depreciation.
Future expansion includes accounts (saving features) and AI to enhance the experience.

## Requirements:
Node.js - npm (local hosting only)

Youtube Data API v3 and Spotify Web API client id and secret which are all avaliable for free:

https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

https://console.cloud.google.com/ (limitation to discover 100 new songs per day)






## Instructions For Local Hosting (Visual Studio terminal)

```
cd musicapp
npm install
npm run dev
```
